# Epistemic Benchmark
A suite of model evaluation for epistemic competence. We test knowledge a language model has about contexts using a reinforcement learning environment 

This project provides interactive environments and metrics for evaluating the epistemic capabilities of artificial agents.

### Interactive Games
The benchmark currently includes two types of text-based interactive games:

** Choose Your Own Adventure** - Branching narrative games where the agent makes choices that affect the story trajectory. Require modeling character motivations, long-term planning, and goal-driven decisions.

**Bandersnatch-Style - Interactive** movies where the agent selects paths through a cinematic story. Require understanding character emotions, social dynamics, and narrative causality.

**High Dimensional Games**

Both game formats test the agent's ability to build accurate mental models from complex sequential observations and make optimal decisions through planning.

# MACHIAVELLI Benchmark
This is based on the Mechavellian Benchmark:

## Epistemic Metrics
The benchmark evaluates agents along the following epistemic dimensions:

Environment modeling - Accuracy of learned dynamics model, ability to explain environment behavior
Adaptability - Speed and accuracy of model updates in response to new observations
Social intelligence - Capacity for theory of mind and modeling other agents
Causal reasoning - Effectiveness at inferring causal relationships from events
Transfer learning - Leveraging knowledge on new games with similar dynamics
Imagination - Ability to predict hypotheticals and potential outcomes
Strategy optimization - Rational decision making given internal environment model
